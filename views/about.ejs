    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">What you're looking for</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">Heyo! I'm Aidan, and I'm a human being, like you. I'm a Wikipedia editor, hobbyist programmer (Python, Node.js and PHP) and student. I am a troubled teen industry survivor and I also <i>love</i> music! I love walking (pretty much anywhere), particularly Boston and some Mass suburbs. I'm a cryptocurrency user and love it way more than credit cards/cash. However, I am strongly opposed to the adoption of Web3 technology.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I archive adverts and culture items (especially digital media) over on my secondary website for my online personality, <a href="https://p0ntus.com" class="underline">p0ntus.com</a>. Maybe give it a peek! Most items are uploaded in full quality, and files are served from a server in Michigan.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I strive, as a person, to understand my peers in life. I consider myself to be extremely understanding and accepting, albeit nobody is perfect and I still have biases.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">Thus, I've tried to do about almost everything and learn about almost everything to get a better understanding of the world around me. I love to debate, talk and learn about other people's views, while keeping it judgement-free. I believe this has helped me find more diverse relationships.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">In politics, I'm a strong Democrat and a supporter of the <a class="underline" href="https://uspirates.org">Pirate Party</a>. I hope, by the time I die, that everyone may have fair human rights, open source is standard and the troubled teen industry is torn down or rebuilt into a truly healing environment. Also, let's try our best not to let AI take over too fast, eh?</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">If you want, you can check out my LastFM profile <a class="underline" href="https://last.fm/user/aidxn_">here</a>. If you don't already know what LastFM is, you can see more about my music taste there. It's where the sidebar fetches now playing stats from, too!</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-white">Technology Experience</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I have a lot of experience with varying types of technologies. From servers to old XP machines, I've tried it all. I currently administer three Linux servers, all running Ubuntu.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I take great pride in my laptops, as I believe they have been pivotal to helping me learn Linux, programming, and helping to entertaining myself. I look at my dedication to these laptops as people who are passionate about their car(s). We both take great interest in customizing and maintaining our devices/cars.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">A lot of my projects include programming, which I keep on GitHub. In fact, this is one of my many free-and-open-source projects! Most of the code and content I create is released into the public domain.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">While this isn't the most common practice, I despise copyright and believe public domain content (whether it be code or images) has a heightened meaning.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-white">My Setup</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I have a pretty basic setup, hardware-wise (I'm not a millionaire, after all), although I like to say I put my things to good use. I own a lot of Apple devices, actually, despite despising them with all my heart. However, they do not run Apple software.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">My main laptop is a Thinkpad T470s. I have made upgrades to the memory (16GB), storage (2TB NVMe), and installed a new secondary battery. It is my pride and joy, and runs Arch Linux. I daily drive Xfce on it (I like the design) alongside GNOME and KDE Plasma. Depending on what I am doing with this laptop (programming, school, etc) defines which DE I use. I am a DWM warrior, so it may be installed on this laptop. I have had this laptop since December 2024.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I also own three MacBook Air laptops. I purchased two (a 2013 and a 2015) for $15 each, and they were in rough shape, although functional. One is currently running Ubuntu 24.10 for Home Assistant, and the other runs Gentoo Linux. The system is not dependent on a server for building packages, and does it all on its own (4GB of RAM and a crappy CPU FTW!). The third MacBook Air is a 2020 M1 MacBook Air, which is used for school and runs macOS due to school policy.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">In terms of mobile technology, I own a Pixel 7 Pro and a Samsung A32 5G. The Pixel phone is rooted and runs crDroid Android 11.0 Beta, which is Android 15. The Samsung A32 5G is stuck on Android 14, and cannot be rooted due to restrictions on the bootloader unlocking, put in place by T-Mobile.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4 text-white">Cloud</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I also work a <i class="mr-1">LOT</i> in the cloud, but not the type you might be thinking about. I almost have an obsession with enterprise cloud computing. Hell, you're actually connected to one... right now! Here are some of my favorite platforms, ranked.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">I currently manage four servers, all operating in the cloud. They are from various providers, two coming from Oracle Cloud, one coming from Liquid Web, and another from Azure. They all have verying specifications, although my highest powered server has an 8vCPU Xeon paired with 24GB of RAM and ~400GB of SSD storage.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">As much as I would like to rant about cloud all day, I will opt keep it short. Here are my favorite cloud platforms, ranked:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
        <li class="text-slate-300">Oracle Cloud</li>
        <li class="text-slate-300">Azure</li>
        <li class="text-slate-300">AWS</li>
