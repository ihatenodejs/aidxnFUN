        <h1 class="text-3xl text-white py-3.5">My Music Taste</h1>
        <p class="text-slate-300">I am mainly into hip hop and rap, but I appreciate a slower song, as opposed to the fast nature of some rap songs. I feel like I seek songs that match my current energy level, and I can tend to have a low energy level during the day.</p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mt-3">Some of my favorite artists include tobi lou, Flyana Boss, and Kali Uchis. Some of my "classics" are Mike Stud (before his name change to "mike."), Skizzy Mars, tobi lou, The Neighbourhood, and Ryan Caraveo.</p>

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">About the design</h1>
        <p class="text-slate-300">With this revision, I was aiming to provide a modern design, with an easy-to-navigate interface.</p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mt-3">For this design, I chose Tailwind CSS. I appreciate their flexibility, though their documentation is terrible on purpose. They encourage purchasing their components subscription (which costs a lot of money!) all over the place. It has been a poor experience, but I have been able to figure it out with the help of their free elements, documentation, prior knowledge, and the docs.</p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mt-3">This code is also under Public Domain, and can be found <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/ihatenodejs/aidxnFUN">here</a>.
